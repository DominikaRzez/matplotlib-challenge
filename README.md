The study compares the performance of Capomulin treatment with other treatment regimens.

Within the main code can be found:
- summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen;
- bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen (generated by using both Pandas and pyplot);
- pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice (generated by using both Pandas and pyplot);

- box plot of the final tumor volume of each mouse across four regimens of interest (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin);

- line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a selected mouse treated with Capomulin;
- scatter plot of average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen;
- linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.

At the top of the notebook is included a short summary of the analysis with a few observations that can be made from the data provided.
